# Mini-Url

Mini-Url is (for the time being) a headless app that:

* Takes a URL and gives back a mini-url
* Shows the URL that a mini-url will redirect to
* Provides a list of the top 100 urls that have been submitted

The mini-url is generated by taking the unique database ID of the url, converting it to base 36, and appending to the base URL.



**To generate a mini-url:**

```curl -X POST -d "url={your url here}" https://a-mini-url.herokuapp.com/api/urls```
The current version requires http or https to be included in your url`*

**To see the redirect url:**

```curl -I {your mini-url here}```

for example:

```curl -I https://a-mini-url.herokuapp.com/api/urls/1```


**To see the top 100 urls:**

```curl https://a-mini-url.herokuapp.com/api/urls```
